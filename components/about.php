            <br><br>
            The IEEE WIE Social Hackathon League was established to give engineering students the chance to promote a learning ecosystem. This multi-stage competition and activity aims to introduce engineering students to problem- and project-based learning while also assisting them in gaining useful experience with real-life engineering problems. The occasion is being held in cooperation with numerous chapters of the IEEE Society. Selected student teams will receive guidance from academics and industry experts to produce projects with social impact.
